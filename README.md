# Youtube-Reddit-Modlets
Custom Modlets made for the amazing youtubers I work with, and the reddit community.

DO NOT USE JAWOODLES MODS ON A LIVE SERVER/ACTUAL GAME YOU INTEND TO PLAY. They pretty much all break. They are VERY poorly coded in both Unity and the xml. They are for recording purposes only/having fun. They WILL break your game. I am not responsible for it.

Puddin's mod is 100% good to go. Very light gate behind everything. Lightsaber is OP, might be cheap to put it on a live server with that low crafting cost.
